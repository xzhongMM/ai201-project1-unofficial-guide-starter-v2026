# Acceptance criteria — The Unofficial Guide

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this system, written in unit 1
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"Retrieval works"* is an opinion. *"For at
least 4 of my 5 test questions, the top results include a chunk containing the
answer"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter or looser one. A reason that says something about your corpus or your
pipeline earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include one that contains the answer.

**Why this target:**
One of my questions is about a topic only two documents mention, so I expect that one to be hard.


---

## 2. Every answer names a source

Every answer the system produces names at least one source document.

**Why this target:**
I want the answer to be retrieved from at least one reliable source that I put in here.

---

## 3. The relevance gate stops out-of-corpus questions

When I ask a question my documents clearly don't cover, the relevance gate stops it and the system returns "I don't have enough information about that" — in at least 4 of 5 tries.

<!-- The five questions are the ones in `OUT_OF_SCOPE` at the bottom of
     `questions.py`, and `run_eval.py` puts them through the gate and writes
     what happened into your run log. Swap them for your own if you'd rather —
     just keep five of them, or the "4 of 5" above has nothing to be 4 of. -->

**Why this target:**
When there's no source related to the question, it's better to stop than trying to "make up" an answer and waste tokens.

---

## 4. No chunk has incomplete sentences.

For at least 4 of 5 sampled chunks, the text reads as a complete thought, with no sentence cut in half at either end.

**Why this target:**
A chunk that ends mid-sentence is unreadable and a clear sign the chunk boundaries are wrong. I want the answer to read cleanly on its own instead of feeling like incomplete.

---

## 5. The named source is the correct one

For at least 4 of 5 answers, the source document named in the response is one that actually contains the answer to the question, not just a related topic.

**Why this target:**
In a campus-life corpus, several documents are about nearby policies or procedures, so a system can easily cite a plausible-looking file without grounding the answer in the right place. I care about correct attribution because a student trying to follow advice needs the right document, not just any document that sounds similar.

     UNIT 2 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 1. Retrieved chunks contain the answer

         For at least 4 of my 5 test questions, the retrieved chunks include
         one that contains the answer.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 2:** For at least 4 of 5 questions, the top three
         > results contain the answer.
         >
         > **Why revised:** I couldn't judge "the chunks include one that
         > contains the answer" the same way twice — I scored two questions
         > differently on Monday than on Wednesday. The new version is
         > something I can actually check.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said 4 of 5 but got 2 of 5, so 2 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.

     The whole reason the originals stay visible is so someone can see what you
     said before you knew the answer.
